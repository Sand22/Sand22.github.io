Hi!

If I had to choose one thing that incessantly makes me want to cherish my 
day job it would be probably JavaScript (and its surroundings). 

The beginnings of my journey on building user interfaces weren't the dream 
ones, though. Those were the dark times with no Chrome around, just IE 6 (oh yeah) 
in town with Firefox as a toddler. I tended to alert everything and put endless 
amount of dates on my static websites. Don't ask me why. But the thing that 
actually is giving me the creeps right now is the lack of Web Inspector back in the days.

But now, when I've grown up a bit, I work with various tools like Angular, React, Meteor, 
[put any fancy word here].js library. I'm the guy that admires good UIs, 
consistent designs and thought-out approach to UX. I hate unneeded complexity
which is very common when you work with developers.

Occasionally I feel like the whole browser-ish 
environment is a little bit unstable, but then again
this is **exactly** what makes it fascinating and hence 
keeps me sane. Can you imagine the Web without all these neat 
tiptop animated components that we enjoy every single day? I surely cannot.

The idea of this blog is to express my attitude and hopefully
make some of you think of JavaScript as more adult and definitely rewarding 
solution to your problems.
